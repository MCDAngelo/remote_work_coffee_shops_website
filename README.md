# Coffee Shops for Remote Work

This is a website, modelled off of [laptopfriendly.co](https://laptopfriendly.co/london) that shows coffee shops where
it is possible to work remotely for a day.

This website allows users to explore the coffee shops that are already in the database, suggest new locales, and flag if a shop is now closed. 

Future iterations will allow users to leave reviews and will show coffee shops on a map.
